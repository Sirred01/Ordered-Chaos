Ordered-Chaos:

A fun project where chaos leads to order, where we start by considering a vertices
of a triangle and a random point on the plane, and compute the distance between
random point and randomly selected vertex of the triangle, the midpoint of the
line joing these two on large iteration shows a fractal triangle
